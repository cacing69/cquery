# Overview

## Requirements

* PHP >= 7.2

## Installation

The recommended way to install Cquery is with Composer. Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP that allows you to declare the dependencies your project needs and installs them into your project.

Install Composer

```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

You can add Cquery as a dependency using Composer:

```bash
composer require cacing69/cquery
```

Alternatively, you can specify Cquery as a dependency in your project's existing composer.json file:

```json
 {
   "require": {
      "cacing69/cquery": "^1.3"
   }
}
```

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

You can find out more on how to install Composer, configure autoloading, and other best-practices for defining dependencies at [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/).
